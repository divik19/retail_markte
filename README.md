**Market and Retail Data Analysis**  

**Situation**:  
Olist, a leading online marketplace, needed to identify revenue-driving products and categories, understand customer purchase behavior, and uncover revenue generation patterns. These insights were crucial for developing targeted marketing strategies, optimizing inventory management, and driving sustained business growth.  

**Task**:  
Analyze Olistâ€™s retail data to uncover actionable insights, provide strategic recommendations, and support data-driven decision-making aimed at boosting sales and operational efficiency.  

**Action**:  
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) to clean and preprocess data, handle missing values, and ensure consistency for accurate analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA with Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends, identify revenue drivers, and explore customer purchase behavior.  
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Created a focused dataset to analyze order IDs and product categories, uncovering frequently ordered category associations for cross-selling opportunities.  
- **Visualization and Reporting**: Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau, effectively communicating insights like the Pareto principle in revenue generation and common purchase combinations.  
- **Strategic Recommendations**:  
  - Suggested inventory optimization by prioritizing high-revenue categories.  
  - Recommended targeted marketing for high-performing categories (e.g., Toys) and cross-promotions with frequently associated products.  
  - Proposed reducing low-performing subcategories to streamline operations.  

**Result**:  
Enabled Olist to develop data-driven strategies for improving sales, optimizing inventory, and enhancing profitability. Insights supported targeted marketing campaigns and operational efficiencies, aligning with business growth objectives.
